I have discovered lithophane on [thingverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74322) and I have try to print some, results were pretty bad but also I discovered that people were pretty amazed by my first attempt.
I have try a lot of different software, and finaly found [this tool](http://3dp.rocks/lithophane/) that match my needs.

### PRINT CHALENGE

Generating the model is the easiest part as a lot of software exist, printing was more chalenging. Depending of your printer resolution and the filament your are using results are inconsitents.
I have try a bunch of settings, slicers parameters and fillaments...

### BEST RESULT

I get the best result using a vertical print position and a [natural PLA](https://www.matterhackers.com/store/3d-printer-filament/175mm-pla-filament-natural-1-kg)
