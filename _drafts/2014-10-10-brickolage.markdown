## MY LEGO WALL
Everything started with my office LEgo wall, we started making pixel art using small bricks. I set this wall as an open canva where everybody could create, I started with Mario Bross and then we had Bomber man, bob the sponge, space invaders, etc. Later people used the wall to display messages or font based logo. Create un message with Lego is quite complexe and you endup with a deceptive result. That's where the idea of creating some "Lego" brick font came.

## THE FIRST POC
I started designing "Lego" chars by hand using 123Design but that rapidly became a nigthmare because it's complexity + I also wanted to been abble to generate all font char at once. But a least I had a first working POC:
