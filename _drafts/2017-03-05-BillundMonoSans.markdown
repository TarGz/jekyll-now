        <p>I was working for a while on this idea of creating a alphabet of "Lego" bricks and after <a href="/leisure/playing-with-3D-printable-lego-typeface/">different attempt</a> and a lot of experiments I finaly focused on making a monospaced font, to be align with what Lego bricks are I decided to work on a mono spaced font and try to make the letters as small as possible and finally I use 3x5 lego unit for each letters and 1 unit as space.</p>
        <p>This 3x5 lego unit bring a lot of constrain so it was really challenging to find a desing that meet the monospace requirement and get this "lego look" I was seeking for.  </p>
