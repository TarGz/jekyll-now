### CONCEPT

My wife wanted to get his own business and we were looking for some idea, for my side I wanted to create an e-commerce website. As we had 3 kids we had a lot of clothes so some day we where making room in the basement and we tought that difficult to get `ride` of clothes in good condition, you can't just put them in the trash, because you know kid clothes are really expensive and they may be valuable to someone. So we tough that maybe somewhere parents would like to buy affordable clothes in good condition and maybe some other wanted to make room in their basement and make money of it.

Some stuffs where allready existing in France (ebay, le bon coin) and people where using those website to sell and buy used kids clothes. We tried a bunch of other solution but at the end the experience was pretty bad, at this point we knew that something interesting can be done.

Our main partis pris were : 

- *Simple to sell and buy*
- *Cheap to buy*
- *Valuable to sell*

`To make this possible we choosed to buy clothes before selling them, the other option were to make a market place but it feel to complexe to us.

### DEVELOPEMENT

We "simply" had to build an e-commerce website, at the begining we were focused on the website itself, UX, desgin, features, etc. It take us 1 year to launch the first version. That were have starting working on make us know, that's apparently something that people often forget :): you need to get traffic to sell stuf. We have made a lot of differents things like addwork, facebook add, sponsorised blog post, contest with blogers, PR releasse, blogers event and so on. Everything was iteresting but at the end that's the SEO work that were the most valuable and really start our business.

### BIG AMOUNT OF CLOTHES
To make this business interesting you need to handle a big volume of clothes because margin are `thigt`. We are generally putting online aroung 300 clothes per week.
